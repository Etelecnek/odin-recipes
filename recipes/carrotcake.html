        <p><h2><strong>Allreceipes Community Tips and Praise</strong></h2></p>
        <p><h4>"This recipe is fabulous," according to Joyce. "I made it exactly as written and it has been a favorite of my family for years. I even make it for my vegan granddaughter by using an egg substitute."

            "I have tried various carrot cakes, but this by far was [our] favorite," says one Allrecipes community member. "It was light, airy, moist and not too sweet. I chose to use brown sugar, raisins, and extra cinnamon."
            
            "Amazing carrot cake recipe," raves Stefanie. "I wouldn't change a thing! A tip: Squeeze as much of the juice out of the carrots as you can before mixing it in and the cake won't be overly wet and soggy in the middle."

        <p><h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.</h4></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4>Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into the prepared pan.</h4></p>
