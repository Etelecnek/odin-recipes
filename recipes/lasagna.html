        <p><h2><strong>Allreceipes Community Tips and Praise</strong></h2></p>
        <p><h4>"We live in St. Louis where we have fabulous Italian food," says meyerrachelle. "This lasagna could've come from any of the well-known restaurants in our area. My family was raving about it! The sauce is absolutely amazing! This is definitely a keeper! It lives up to its name."

            "The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce were very flavorful," says one Allrecipes community member. "Yeah it may take a while but it is so worth it. Team it with garlic bread and a salad and you'll be very satisfied."
            
            "Absolutely phenomenal," raves Amanda Simopoulos. "Fair warning: once you've made this, going back to a frozen lasagna will be impossible. It is somewhat time consuming but not difficult. My house smells delectable every time I make it!

                <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</strong></h4></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</strong></h4></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</strong></h4></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4><strong>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</strong></h4></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Step 5</strong></h4></p>
        <p><h4><strong>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</strong></h4></p>
